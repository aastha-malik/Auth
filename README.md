## Purpose

This repository is a reusable authentication module built with FastAPI.
It serves as a reference implementation for authentication workflows such as:
- Email/password authentication
- JWT-based access control
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Google OAuth 2.0 login

This module is intentionally backend-only and is designed to be reused across
multiple projects without rewriting authentication logic.
